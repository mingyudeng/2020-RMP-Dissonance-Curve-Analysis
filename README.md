# 2020-RMP-Dissonance-Curve-Analysis

This respository consists of a Python module for audio and dissonance curve analyses based on William A. Sethares' principle of local consonance, and an interactive graphical user interface developed for Max/MSP that allows the user to audition the timbre transposed to the various scale steps suggested by the aforementioned dissonance curve analysis. This is the code for the research "A User-Friendly Interface for Relating Timbre and Scale Using Dissonance Curve Analysis" completed in the summer of 2020.
